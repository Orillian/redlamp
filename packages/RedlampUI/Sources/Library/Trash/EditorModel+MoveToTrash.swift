/// puts them back, and Library's ⌘Z takes the batch back, the photos selected as they were. No photo leaves Redlamp

///   Develop's Masking and Healing tools, a mask or spot selected or not; ⌘⌫ is Put Back's in Recently Trashed, where
///   Move to Trash is off. Elsewhere both are Move to Trash's (`ShortcutAction.givesKeys`, `claimsKey`). Held, neither
///   repeats: each press is one batch.
/// - **The photo after:** the photos leave the grid and the filmstrip at once, before the batch runs, and the photo
///   after the active one that stays becomes active, else the one before it; in Develop it opens there. With none
///   left, no photo is open (`EditorModel+Files`).
/// - **Said:** the notice over the photos says what went, as it says what Undo takes back, and the activity log
///   records it; an alert says why when nothing went.
/// - **Kept in Apple Photos:** those photos don't go; an alert says why and offers Remove from Library (LIB-62,
///   `EditorModel+KeptInPhotos`), the other photos going to the Trash.
