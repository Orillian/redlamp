/// Thumbnails and previews that show the edit (LIB-17). An edited photo the library shows is rendered
/// with its edit by Redlamp's own engine, in an engine of the library's own (`makeEngine`), at the
/// store's preview size, and its preview and grid tiers are stored under its content key and its edit's
/// digest (`EditDigest(rendering:)`). Until they're there, its embedded preview shows, marked so it's
/// clear which is showing: the loaders ask `shownEdit(for:)` which to load, and the views `renders(_:)`
/// whether to mark it.
///
/// - Order: the photos on screen first (the grid's, the filmstrip's and the active photo), then those
///   within a screen of them, nearest first, then the rest of the source in its order. A photo's sidecar
///   is read off the main thread for its edit's digest, up to `readAhead` photos ahead of the renders.
/// - Relaunching: the index records each photo's edit once its render is stored, with the date its sidecar had
///   (`PhotoEdit`), and the photo comes from the index with it (`LibraryItem.renderedEdit`) while its sidecar's
///   date is the same, so its render shows from the start, before its sidecar is read again.
/// - Changes: a photo whose sidecar or file changed (the editor's saves, and other apps' changes that
///   LibraryLive reports) is read again, showing what it showed until then. When its edit changed, it
///   shows its embedded preview until the new edit is rendered, never the old edit's, whose renders leave
///   the store unless another copy of the photo shows them. A photo given its first edit is read and rendered
///   in its turn, as the others are, wherever it is in the source.
/// - Develop first: a render starts, and goes from one step to the next (opening the photo, rendering
///   it), only while no export runs and no dialog is open, Develop isn't shown or has asked for no frame
///   for `developQuiet` and isn't opening a photo, no thumbnail on screen waits, and the Mac isn't hot or
///   saving power. The photo open in Develop waits until it's left. `statistics` counts the waits, and Develop's frames
/// asked for
///   while a step ran.
/// - Bounded: one render at a time, cancelled when its photo leaves the source or its edit changes. The
///   engine is let go once the photos it opened would hold more than `engineBudget` on the GPU, and after
///   `engineIdle` with nothing to render.
/// - Versions (LIB-48): a photo is known by its address, a file's own edit or one of its versions, whose edit is the
///   version's in the file's sidecar (`Sidecar[edit:]`) and whose render is recorded under its own row. A file's
///   photos with the same edit share its render, and the renders of the edits its sidecar holds stay while another
///   source shows the photos that have them.
